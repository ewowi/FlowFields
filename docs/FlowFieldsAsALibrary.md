# FlowFields as a PlatformIO Library

## Goal

Allow FastLED-MM (and any other project) to add FlowFields as a PlatformIO library dependency:

```ini
lib_deps = ewowi/FlowFields
```

…and wrap the engine in a `ProducerModule` subclass so all emitters, flows, and parameters are
available through the FastLED-MM / projectMM UI system without any BLE dependency.

---

## What Needs to Change

### 1. Global variables defined in headers (ODR violation)

`flowFieldsTypes.h` defines variables directly in the header (not just declares them):

```cpp
bool flowFieldsInstance = false;
uint16_t (*xyFunc)(uint8_t x, uint8_t y);
float globalSpeed = 1.0f;
float persistence = 0.05f;
// …etc
```

When a library consumer includes this header from multiple translation units the linker sees
multiple definitions of the same symbol — a hard build error.  The fix is to move all
definitions into a class so each instance owns its own copy.

### 2. Compile-time grid dimensions

`HEIGHT` and `WIDTH` come from `boardConfig.h` as compile-time `#define`s, and the grids are
declared as static 2-D arrays:

```cpp
static float gR[HEIGHT][WIDTH], gG[HEIGHT][WIDTH], gB[HEIGHT][WIDTH];
```

A library consumer's LED panel may be a different size, or the size may not be known until
`setup()`.  The grids must become dynamically allocated at runtime.

### 3. No library manifest

PlatformIO needs a `library.json` at the repo root to resolve `lib_deps = ewowi/FlowFields`.
The file tells the package manager which source files belong to the library (everything except
`main.cpp` and the BLE/hardware layer).

### 4. No lifecycle API

The engine currently exposes only free functions (`initFlowFields`, `runFlowFields`).  A library
consumer needs an object it can instantiate, configure, and destroy — matching the
`setup / loop / teardown / onSizeChanged` pattern used by FastLED-MM's `ProducerModule`.

---

## Proposed Changes

### Phase 1 — Wrap the engine in a class

Create `src/FlowFieldsEngine.h` (or promote the existing `flowFieldsEngine.hpp` to a class).
Move every namespace-level variable in `flowFieldsTypes.h` and `flowFieldsEngine.hpp` into
`FlowFieldsEngine` as member variables.

Public interface:

```cpp
class FlowFieldsEngine {
public:
    // Lifecycle
    void setup(uint8_t width, uint8_t height, uint16_t numLeds,
               uint16_t (*xyFunc)(uint8_t x, uint8_t y));
    void run(fl::CRGB* leds);   // one complete frame: prepare + emit + advect + copy
    void teardown();            // free grids

    // Selection
    void setEmitter(uint8_t idx);
    void setFlow(uint8_t idx);

    // Parameter API — set/get any parameter by its camelCase name
    void  setParam(const char* name, float value);
    float getParam(const char* name) const;

    // Direct cVar access (kept for the BLE layer in main.cpp)
    float cOrbitSpeed   = 0.35f;
    float cGlobalSpeed  = 1.0f;
    float cPersistence  = 0.05f;
    // …all other cVars as public members…
};
```

The emitter and flow functions currently read namespace globals (`t`, `dt`, `gR[y][x]`, etc.).
Introduce a single file-scope pointer:

```cpp
// in FlowFieldsEngine.cpp (or at the top of the .hpp implementation block)
static FlowFieldsEngine* g_engine = nullptr;
```

`FlowFieldsEngine::run()` sets `g_engine = this` before dispatching to any emitter/flow
function.  Because embedded targets run single-threaded and only one engine instance is active
at a time, this is safe.  All existing emitter/flow headers continue to read `g_engine->gAt(x,y)`
etc. with minimal changes.

Alternatively (cleaner but more refactor work): pass `FlowFieldsEngine&` as a parameter to
every emitter/flow function.  The dispatch table types change to
`using EmitterFn = void(*)(FlowFieldsEngine&)`.  This makes the data-flow explicit and removes
the global pointer entirely — recommended if touch-up of all headers is acceptable.

### Phase 2 — Dynamic grid allocation

Replace the static 2-D arrays with heap-allocated 1-D arrays and inline accessors:

```cpp
// In FlowFieldsEngine (private members)
float* gR = nullptr;
float* gG = nullptr;
float* gB = nullptr;
float* tR = nullptr;
float* tG = nullptr;
float* tB = nullptr;
uint8_t  _width  = 0;
uint8_t  _height = 0;
uint16_t _numLeds = 0;

// Inline accessor replacing gR[y][x]
inline float& gRAt(int x, int y) { return gR[y * _width + x]; }
```

`setup()` allocates:

```cpp
void FlowFieldsEngine::setup(uint8_t w, uint8_t h, uint16_t n,
                              uint16_t (*xy)(uint8_t, uint8_t)) {
    teardown();   // safe to call even before first setup
    _width = w; _height = h; _numLeds = n; xyFunc = xy;
    size_t sz = (size_t)w * h;
    gR = new float[sz](); gG = new float[sz](); gB = new float[sz]();
    tR = new float[sz](); tG = new float[sz](); tB = new float[sz]();
    // init noise, timers, etc.
}

void FlowFieldsEngine::teardown() {
    delete[] gR; delete[] gG; delete[] gB;
    delete[] tR; delete[] tG; delete[] tB;
    gR = gG = gB = tR = tG = tB = nullptr;
}
```

Every place that currently writes `gR[y][x]` becomes `gRAt(x, y)` (or the g_engine pointer
version: `g_engine->gRAt(x, y)`).  A find-replace across the emitter/flow headers handles
the bulk of this.

### Phase 3 — Pointer binding (zero hot-path overhead)

The goal is that `loop()` contains only `engine_.run(leds_)`.  All parameter bridging happens
via **pointer binding** set up once during `setup()`.

#### Design

Each parameter in the engine is backed by two things:
- A public `float cXxx` member — the default storage, written to directly by the BLE layer.
- A private `float* pXxx` pointer — defaults to `&cXxx`, but can be redirected to any
  caller-owned float during `setup()`.

`run()` reads only through the pointers — one dereference per parameter, no string lookups,
no copies.  Because the pointers are set during `setup()` they are effectively constants at
runtime.

```cpp
class FlowFieldsEngine {
public:
    // ── Default storage (the BLE layer writes here directly) ─────────────
    float cEmitter     = 0.0f;   // float so all bindings are uniform
    float cFlow        = 0.0f;
    float cGlobalSpeed = 1.0f;
    float cPersistence = 0.05f;
    float cOrbitSpeed  = 0.35f;
    // … all other cVars …

    // ── Redirect a pointer to a caller-owned float (call once in setup) ──
    // The string lookup happens only here, never in run().
    void bindParam(const char* name, float* externalPtr);

    // ── Lifecycle ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    void setup(uint8_t w, uint8_t h, uint16_t n,
               uint16_t (*xy)(uint8_t, uint8_t));
    void run(fl::CRGB* leds);   // hot path — pointer dereferences only
    void teardown();

private:
    // Pointers default to the public cVar members above.
    float* pEmitter     = &cEmitter;
    float* pFlow        = &cFlow;
    float* pGlobalSpeed = &cGlobalSpeed;
    float* pOrbitSpeed  = &cOrbitSpeed;
    // …
};
```

`bindParam` does a one-time string look-up (fine in `setup()`, never called in `run()`):

```cpp
void FlowFieldsEngine::bindParam(const char* name, float* ptr) {
    #define X(ptrMember, paramName) \
        if (strcasecmp(name, #paramName) == 0) { ptrMember = ptr; return; }
    X(pEmitter,     "emitter")
    X(pFlow,        "flow")
    X(pGlobalSpeed, "globalSpeed")
    X(pOrbitSpeed,  "orbitSpeed")
    // …
    #undef X
}
```

Inside `run()`, reading a parameter is just:

```cpp
uint8_t emitterIdx = (uint8_t)*pEmitter;   // plain pointer dereference
float   speed      = *pGlobalSpeed;
```

#### BLE / `main.cpp` usage — no binding needed

BLE callbacks write directly to the engine's `cXxx` public members.  Because `pXxx` defaults
to `&cXxx`, `run()` sees the updated value immediately with no extra wiring:

```cpp
// BLE callback on value change:
engine.cOrbitSpeed = newValue;   // pOrbitSpeed still points here → run() picks it up
```

#### FastLED-MM usage — bind once, loop is one line

```cpp
void setup() override {
    engine_.setup(WIDTH, HEIGHT, NUM_LEDS, myXY);
    addControl(emitter_,     "emitter",    "select", 0, EMITTER_COUNT - 1);
    addControl(globalSpeed_, "globalSpeed","slider",  0.1f, 5.0f);
    addControl(orbitSpeed_,  "orbitSpeed", "slider",  0.01f, 25.0f);
    // … register all controls …

    // Bind: engine reads the ProducerModule's floats directly, no copies in loop
    engine_.bindParam("emitter",     &emitter_);
    engine_.bindParam("globalSpeed", &globalSpeed_);
    engine_.bindParam("orbitSpeed",  &orbitSpeed_);
    // …
}

void loop() override {
    engine_.run(leds_);   // ← this is the entire hot path
}
```

projectMM updates `orbitSpeed_` when the slider moves; `run()` dereferences `pOrbitSpeed`
which now points at `orbitSpeed_` — zero latency, zero overhead.

### Phase 4 — Library manifest

Add `library.json` at the repo root:

```json
{
  "name": "FlowFields",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Emitter + FlowField + Modulator LED visualization engine for ESP32/FastLED",
  "keywords": ["fastled", "led", "visualization", "esp32", "effects"],
  "authors": [{"name": "ewowi", "url": "https://github.com/ewowi"}],
  "repository": {"type": "git", "url": "https://github.com/ewowi/FlowFields"},
  "license": "MIT",
  "frameworks": ["arduino"],
  "platforms": ["espressif32"],
  "dependencies": [{"name": "fastled/FastLED", "version": ">=4.0.0"}],
  "build": {
    "srcDir": "src",
    "includeDir": "src",
    "srcFilter": "+<**/*> -<main.cpp> -<hosted_ble_bridge.cpp>"
  }
}
```

**Explicitly excluded by `srcFilter`** (the two `.cpp` files that would cause linker conflicts):

- `main.cpp` — the standalone firmware entry point
- `hosted_ble_bridge.cpp` — the hosted/desktop BLE simulation

**Effectively excluded** (headers that are never included by the library's own code — only pulled in via `main.cpp`):

- `bleControl.h` — BLE stack, parameter table, cVar declarations
- `boardConfig.h` — hardware pin assignments, compile-time `WIDTH`/`HEIGHT`, matrix maps
- `audio/` — all six audio headers
- `hosted_ble_bridge.h` — companion to the `.cpp`
- `profiler.h` — frame timing diagnostics
- `reference/` — hardware-specific XY lookup tables

**Included in the library** (everything else in `src/`):

- `FlowFieldsEngine.h` / `flowFieldsEngine.cpp` — engine class declaration and method implementations
- `flowFieldsTypes.h`, `modulators.h`, `componentEnums.h`, `parameterSchema.h` — types and shared parameter globals
- All six emitter headers (`emitters/`)
- All six flow headers (`flows/`)

The existing standalone firmware continues to build normally via `platformio.ini`; that build
includes `main.cpp` in `src/` as usual.

### Phase 5 — FastLED-MM ProducerModule example

Create `examples/FastLEDMM/FlowFieldsEffect.h`.  All setup work — control registration and
pointer binding — happens in `setup()`.  The `loop()` is a single call.

```cpp
#pragma once
#include <projectMM.h>
#include <FlowFieldsEngine.h>   // from lib_deps = ewowi/FlowFields

class FlowFieldsEffect : public ProducerModule {
public:
    const char* name()     const override { return "FlowFields"; }
    const char* category() const override { return "source"; }
    uint8_t preferredCore() const override { return 0; }

    uint16_t pixelWidth()  const override { return WIDTH; }
    uint16_t pixelHeight() const override { return HEIGHT; }

    void setup() override {
        declareBuffer(leds_, NUM_LEDS, sizeof(fl::CRGB));

        // 1. Register controls — projectMM owns and updates these floats.
        addControl(emitter_,     "emitter",     "select", 0.0f, (float)(EMITTER_COUNT - 1));
        addControl(flow_,        "flow",         "select", 0.0f, (float)(FLOW_COUNT - 1));
        addControl(globalSpeed_, "globalSpeed",  "slider", 0.1f, 5.0f);
        addControl(persistence_, "persistence",  "slider", 0.01f, 2.0f);
        addControl(colorShift_,  "colorShift",   "slider", 0.0f, 1.0f);
        addControl(orbitSpeed_,  "orbitSpeed",   "slider", 0.01f, 25.0f);
        addControl(numDots_,     "numDots",      "slider", 1.0f, 20.0f);
        // … one addControl per parameter …

        // 2. Init the engine for this panel size.
        engine_.setup(WIDTH, HEIGHT, NUM_LEDS, myXY);

        // 3. Bind: redirect engine pointers to the floats projectMM updates.
        //    Done once here; run() costs only a pointer dereference per param.
        engine_.bindParam("emitter",     &emitter_);
        engine_.bindParam("flow",        &flow_);
        engine_.bindParam("globalSpeed", &globalSpeed_);
        engine_.bindParam("persistence", &persistence_);
        engine_.bindParam("colorShift",  &colorShift_);
        engine_.bindParam("orbitSpeed",  &orbitSpeed_);
        engine_.bindParam("numDots",     &numDots_);
        // …
    }

    void onSizeChanged() override {
        engine_.teardown();
        engine_.setup(pixelWidth(), pixelHeight(), pixelWidth() * pixelHeight(), myXY);
        // Bindings survive teardown/setup because they point into this object's members.
    }

    void loop() override {
        engine_.run(leds_);   // ← entire hot path
    }

    void teardown() override { engine_.teardown(); }

    size_t classSize() const override { return sizeof(*this); }

private:
    fl::CRGB leds_[NUM_LEDS];
    FlowFieldsEngine engine_;

    // One float per parameter — projectMM writes here when controls change.
    float emitter_     = 0.0f;
    float flow_        = 0.0f;
    float globalSpeed_ = 1.0f;
    float persistence_ = 0.05f;
    float colorShift_  = 0.20f;
    float orbitSpeed_  = 0.35f;
    float numDots_     = 5.0f;
    // …
};

REGISTER_MODULE(FlowFieldsEffect)
```

`NUM_LEDS`, `WIDTH`, `HEIGHT`, and `myXY` come from the example's `main.cpp` (same as in the
existing standalone firmware).

### Phase 6 — Minimal changes to the existing `main.cpp`

The standalone firmware changes only at the two call sites.  No pointer binding is needed
because the BLE layer writes directly to the engine's public `cXxx` members, and the engine's
pointers default to pointing at those same members.

```cpp
// BEFORE
if (!flowFields::flowFieldsInstance) {
    flowFields::initFlowFields(myXY);
}
flowFields::runFlowFields();

// AFTER — hot loop is identical in shape
static FlowFieldsEngine engine;
if (!engineInitialized) {
    engine.setup(WIDTH, HEIGHT, NUM_LEDS, myXY);
    engineInitialized = true;
}
engine.run(leds);   // ← same single call, same hot path cost
```

BLE callbacks continue to write directly to the engine's members:

```cpp
// In bleControl.h / processNumber() — no change in behaviour:
engine.cOrbitSpeed = newValue;   // pOrbitSpeed points here by default → run() sees it
```

`sendEmitterState()` / `sendFlowState()` read from the same public members to serialise state
back to the UI — no additional API needed.

| `src/FlowFieldsEngine.h` | **New** — `FlowFieldsEngine` class declaration |
| `src/flowFieldsEngine.hpp` | Convert namespace functions → class member implementations |
| `src/flowFieldsTypes.h` | Remove variable definitions; keep type/constant declarations only; add `gRAt` etc. helpers |
| `src/emitters/*.h` | Replace `gR[y][x]` → `g_engine->gRAt(x,y)`, `t` → `g_engine->t`, etc. |
| `src/flows/*.h` | Same as emitters |

---

## Implementation Order

1. `FlowFieldsEngine` class skeleton with dynamic grids (Phase 1 + 2) — verify standalone build
2. Update all emitter/flow headers to use `g_engine` accessors — verify visuals unchanged
3. Add pointer binding (Phase 3) — update BLE layer to write to `engine.cXxx` members
4. Add `library.json` (Phase 4) — verify `lib_deps = ewowi/FlowFields` installs cleanly
5. Write and test `FlowFieldsEffect.h` example (Phase 5)

---

## Effort Estimate & Sequencing

### Per-phase breakdown

| Phase | Description | Estimate |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| 1 — `FlowFieldsEngine` class | Extract ~40 namespace globals into a class; add `g_engine` pointer; convert `initFlowFields`/`runFlowFields` to `setup()`/`run()`; move drawing primitives to member functions | 3–4 h |
| 2 — Dynamic grids | Replace `static float gR[HEIGHT][WIDTH]` with `float**` (row-pointer arrays); add `allocGrid`/`freeGrid` helpers; update all 50 grid access sites to `g_engine->gR[y][x]`; refactor `flow_fluid.h`'s internal functions from `float (*x)[WIDTH]` to `float**` (that file owns 6 internal 2D arrays and 5 helper functions that all need updating) | 3–4 h |
| 3 — Pointer binding | Add `float* pXxx` members defaulting to `&cXxx`; add `bindParam()`; update `bleControl.h` call sites | 1–2 h |
| 4 — `library.json` | New file, zero risk | 30 min |
| 5 — FastLED-MM example | New file | 1–2 h |
| 6 — `main.cpp` | 4 call-site changes + set 2 callbacks | 30 min |

**Session 1** (Phase 1 + 2 + 6): ~7–9 hours. This is the structural core. Verify the standalone
BLE firmware builds and visuals are identical before proceeding.

**Session 2** (Phase 3 + 4 + 5): ~3–5 hours. Purely additive — no existing behaviour can
break once Session 1 is verified.

### Why phase-by-phase, not all at once

Session 1 contains the only real risk: two independent mechanical changes (class extraction and
grid refactor) happen simultaneously, and `flow_fluid.h` needs the most invasive edit. Keeping
Session 2 separate means a known-good checkpoint exists before the public API surface is
finalised. A broken `bindParam` call or `library.json` misconfiguration is much easier to
diagnose when the underlying engine is already verified.

## For the FlowFields Repo Owner — Impact & Benefits

### What changes in your repo

The table below shows every file that would be touched in a pull request.  Files marked
**unchanged** are not part of the PR at all.

| File | Change | Detail |
|------|--------|--------|
| `src/flowFieldsTypes.h` | Refactor | Variable *definitions* moved into `FlowFieldsEngine` class; the file keeps all type declarations, math helpers, noise classes, and drawing primitives exactly as they are |
| `src/flowFieldsEngine.hpp` | Refactor | Free functions `initFlowFields` / `runFlowFields` become `FlowFieldsEngine::setup` / `::run`; logic is identical |
| `src/emitters/*.h` | Minor edit | `gR[y][x]` → `g_engine->gRAt(x,y)`, `t` → `g_engine->t` — mechanical find-replace, no logic changes |
| `src/flows/*.h` | Minor edit | Same find-replace as emitters |
| `src/main.cpp` | 4 lines changed | `initFlowFields(myXY)` → `engine.setup(...)`, `runFlowFields()` → `engine.run(leds)` |
| `src/bleControl.h` | 1 line per cVar | Bare global `cOrbitSpeed` → `engine.cOrbitSpeed` — same name, same type, same value |
| `library.json` | **New file** | PlatformIO manifest; does not affect the firmware build at all |
| `examples/FastLEDMM/FlowFieldsEffect.h` | **New file** | Consumer example; not compiled by the standalone firmware |
| Everything else | **Unchanged** | `audio/`, `modulators.h`, `parameterSchema.h`, `componentEnums.h`, `index.html`, `platformio.ini`, `boardConfig.h`, … |

The BLE system, the web UI, the audio pipeline, the modulator framework, every emitter, every
flow field — none of their *logic* changes.  The PR is a structural refactor only: state that
currently lives in namespace-level globals moves into a class that owns it.

### What you get in return

**1. Listed in the PlatformIO registry**

Once `library.json` is present and the repo is public, anyone can add your effects to their
project with one line:

```ini
lib_deps = ewowi/FlowFields
```

PlatformIO will resolve, download, and wire up your library automatically.  No forking, no
copying files.

**2. Correct C++ (no ODR violation)**

The current header-defined globals (`bool flowFieldsInstance = false;` etc.) are technically
undefined behaviour when included from more than one translation unit.  The refactor fixes
this, making the code robust as projects grow and add more `.cpp` files.

**3. Runtime-configurable panel size**

The dynamic grid allocation means the engine works on any W×H panel without recompiling.
This benefits your own project too — changing panel size no longer requires a `#define` edit
and a full rebuild.

**4. Wider audience, more contributors**

FastLED-MM / projectMM is used across a growing community of LED installations.  Exposing
FlowFields as a library means those users can drop your emitters and flow fields into their
existing rigs with a single `addControl` / `bindParam` block.  Bug reports, new emitters, and
new flow fields are more likely to come back upstream when the barrier to entry is low.

**5. Your standalone firmware is unaffected**

The existing `platformio.ini`, BLE stack, web UI (`index.html`), and audio pipeline are not
part of the PR.  You flash and run the firmware exactly as you do today.  The only visible
difference in `main.cpp` is four lines.

## Session 1 Retrospective

Session 1 covered Phases 1, 2, and 6 from the plan — the structural core.

### Definition of Done

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| `src/FlowFieldsEngine.h` — class declaration + `g_engine` extern | ✅ | Dynamic grids, noise members, modulator state, lifecycle API, callbacks |
| `src/flowFieldsTypes.h` — stripped to types-only | ✅ | All variable definitions removed; math helpers, noise classes, ColorF, ModConfig kept |
| `src/modulators.h` — stripped to type definitions only | ✅ | `timers` / `modulators` structs only; instances now live in `FlowFieldsEngine` |
| `src/flowFieldsEngine.hpp` — class method implementations | ✅ | `setup`/`run`/`teardown`, `calculate_modulators`, color helpers, drawing primitives, cVar bridge, dispatch tables, `g_engine` definition |
| All 6 emitter headers — `WIDTH`/`HEIGHT`/`MIN_DIMENSION` → `g_engine->` | ✅ | Logic unchanged; mechanical find-replace only |
| 5 simple flow headers — same replacement | ✅ | `flow_noise`, `flow_radial`, `flow_directional`, `flow_rings`, `flow_spiral` |
| `flow_fluid.h` — `SIM_SIZE` constexpr → runtime; `WIDTH`/`HEIGHT` → `g_engine->` | ✅ | Local `SIM_SIZE = (float)g_engine->_minDim` added in each function that uses it |
| `src/main.cpp` — `engine.setup()` / `engine.run()` | ✅ | Old `initFlowFields`/`runFlowFields` removed; callbacks wired |
| `platformio.ini` — GitHub deps instead of local `file://` paths | ✅ | FastLED and NimBLE-Arduino now resolved from GitHub |
| Build compiles cleanly | ✅ | Verified on `seeed_xiao_esp32s3` target |

### What Went Well

- **The `g_engine` pattern was invisible to callers.** All emitter and flow functions needed only a mechanical find-replace (`WIDTH` → `g_engine->_width`, etc.).  No logic changed in any of the 12 component files.
- **Dynamic `float**` grids dropped in without syntax changes.** Callers continue to write `g_engine->gR[y][x]` — the same `[y][x]` notation works for `float**` as for `float[H][W]`.
- **The cVar bridge translated directly.** `pushDefaultsToCVars` and `syncFromCVars` became class methods with no logic changes — they already referenced named structs that are now class members.
- **Separation of concerns paid off.** Because `flowFieldsTypes.h` already grouped types and `flowFieldsEngine.hpp` already grouped logic, the class extraction was a mechanical move, not a redesign.

### What Didn't Go So Well

- **Local library dependencies blocked the build.** `lib/FastLED-e713d6f` and `libNimBLE/NimBLE-Arduino-2.5.0` are gitignored. The specific FastLED commit (e713d6f) also has a `fl::span` overload ambiguity with ESP32 Arduino 3.3.5 that the local copy had apparently been patched to fix. Switched to a pinned FastLED 4.x pre-release commit (`c83f7632`, 2026-04-11) and NimBLE-Arduino from GitHub; the FastLED version change needs on-device verification.
- **`MIN_DIMENSION` in struct defaults was not updated.** Struct member initializers like `float orbitDiam = MIN_DIMENSION * 0.3f` still reference the `boardConfig.h` compile-time macro.  These values are overwritten by `syncFromCVars()` at runtime so behavior is unchanged — but they prevent the struct from being portable to a different grid size without recompiling.
- **pyyaml missing.** PlatformIO's ESP32 Arduino 3.3.5 framework requires `pyyaml` for its build script; had to install it manually.

### Recommendations for Session 2

**Portability cleanup (recommended before Phase 4 library manifest):**

- Replace the remaining `MIN_DIMENSION` references in struct default values with hardcoded constants that match the current tuned defaults (e.g., `orbitDiam = 6.6f`, `lineAmp = 13.5f`).  These are already the effective runtime values on the 22×22 grid.
- `boardConfig.h`'s `myXY()` still uses compile-time `WIDTH`/`HEIGHT` in the bounds check and index arithmetic. For the library's `library.json` to work cleanly, this function (or a replacement) needs to be runtime-aware.  The example `FlowFieldsEffect.h` in Phase 5 should demonstrate a portable `xyFunc`.

**Phase 3 — pointer binding** is purely additive: new `float* pXxx` members defaulting to `&cXxx`, and a `bindParam()` method.  No existing code changes.  Zero risk.

**Phase 4 — `library.json`** is a new file.  Zero risk.

**Phase 5 — FastLED-MM example** is a new file.  Zero risk.

**Before Phase 4:** verify on device that the FastLED version change (pinned pre-release 4.x commit `c83f7632` instead of the old local copy) produces identical visuals.  If there are regressions, bisect to a different 4.x commit in `platformio.ini`.

## Session 2 Retrospective

Session 2 covered the portability cleanup, Phase 4 (library manifest), Phase 5 (illustrative example), Phase 3 (pointer binding), and two pre-use library fixes (ODR violation and missing compiled source).

### Definition of Done

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Portability cleanup — fix null-ptr struct defaults | ✅ | `orbitDiam = g_engine->_minDim * 0.3f` → `6.6f`; `lineAmp = (g_engine->_minDim - 4) * 0.75f` → `13.5f` |
| `library.json` — PlatformIO library manifest | ✅ | ArduinoJson `^7.4.2`; excludes `main.cpp` and `hosted_ble_bridge.cpp`; note on FastLED 4.x pre-release |
| `examples/FastLEDMM/FlowFieldsEffect.h` — integration template | ✅ | `setup()` → `addControl` + `bindParam`; `loop()` → single `engine_.run(leds_)` |
| Phase 3 — pointer binding (`bindParam` + `resolveCVar`) | ✅ | `bindParam(name, float*)` registered once in `setup()`; `run()` applies via pointer deref, zero string lookups in hot path |
| ODR fix — `parameterSchema.h` variable definitions | ✅ | `inline` added to all ~70 non-const variable definitions; safe for C++17 (ESP32 Arduino GCC 12 default) |
| Library source file — `flowFieldsEngine.hpp` → `.cpp` | ✅ | PlatformIO only compiles `.c`/`.cpp` as TUs; `.hpp` was never compiled in library builds → link errors. Renamed; `#pragma once` removed; `#include "flowFieldsEngine.hpp"` removed from `main.cpp` |
| Compile regression fix — missing `FlowFieldsEngine.h` in `main.cpp` | ✅ | Removing the `.hpp` include also removed the only path to the engine class declaration; `#include "FlowFieldsEngine.h"` added explicitly |
| Audio compile fix — `emitters_other.h` `myAudio::` guard | ✅ | All audio code wrapped in `#ifdef AUDIO_ENABLED`; no-op stub compiled otherwise. Prevents compile error when `flowFieldsEngine.cpp` is a separate TU without audio headers |

### What Went Well

- **The null-ptr bug was caught before device testing.** The `g_engine->_minDim` struct default initializers introduced in Session 1's find-replace would have crashed at startup — caught during the portability review step.
- **`library.json` is exactly 20 lines.** The `srcFilter` approach cleanly excludes the BLE/hardware entry points without touching any source file.
- **The example's hot path is a single line.** After pointer binding, `loop()` is `engine_.run(leds_)` — zero copy, zero string lookup per frame.
- **The ODR fix is non-breaking.** `inline` variables in C++17 have identical semantics to non-inline for single-TU projects; they just allow multiple TUs to each see the definition without a linker error.

### What Didn't Go So Well

- **The find-replace in Session 1 introduced the null-ptr bug.** Replacing `MIN_DIMENSION` in struct default initializers with `g_engine->_minDim` was incorrect — `g_engine` is null at static initialization time. The correct fix (hardcoded values) was applied in Session 2.
- **The `.hpp` extension was a latent link-time bomb.** `flowFieldsEngine.hpp` contained all class method implementations, but PlatformIO's library builder only compiles `.c`/`.cpp` files. The main firmware compiled correctly because `main.cpp` `#include`d the file directly, but any library consumer would have seen unresolved symbols. Not caught until pre-use review.
- **ODR violations were hidden.** `parameterSchema.h` defined ~70 mutable variables directly — no `inline`, no `extern` + single definition. The firmware compiled because it was only built as a single TU (main.cpp included everything). A library consumer linking a second TU would have hit duplicate symbol errors immediately.
- **The `.hpp` rename revealed two regressions.** (1) Removing `#include "flowFieldsEngine.hpp"` from `main.cpp` also removed the only path to the `FlowFieldsEngine` class declaration — fixed by adding `#include "FlowFieldsEngine.h"` explicitly. (2) `emitters_other.h` (compiled via `flowFieldsEngine.cpp`) referenced `myAudio::` types that were previously supplied transitively through `main.cpp`'s TU — now a separate TU, those types were invisible. Adding `audioProcessing.h` to `flowFieldsEngine.cpp` would have fixed the compile error but created link-time duplicate-symbol errors (audioTypes.h has non-inline variable definitions). Correct fix: `#ifdef AUDIO_ENABLED` guard with a no-op stub.

### Remaining Backlog

| Item | Priority | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Verify visuals on device with FastLED 4.x | High | Do before merging to `main` |
| `numDots` binding gap | ✅ Done | `cNumDots` changed to `float`; cast to `(uint8_t)` at struct-write sites; added to `resolveCVar` |
| Audio integration (see below) | Medium | Step 1 done (`#ifdef AUDIO_ENABLED` guard + stub). Steps 2–3 remain: `audioTypes.h` inline fix + engine audio-data pointer |
| Typed cVar storage (see below) | Low | All cVars are currently `float`; several should be `uint8_t`, `bool`, or `uint16_t` |
| `boardConfig.h` `myXY()` — make runtime-aware | Low | Relevant when panel size changes at runtime; illustrative example already shows the pattern |

#### Audio integration

**How audio is currently used**

The audio pipeline lives entirely in `src/audio/` and is excluded from the library build. `emitters_other.h` now guards all audio code with `#ifdef AUDIO_ENABLED` and compiles a no-op stub otherwise — so the library and firmware (without `-DAUDIO_ENABLED`) build cleanly. When `AUDIO_ENABLED` is defined, the emitter references:

```cpp
if (myAudio::busC.newBeat) { … }        // beat-triggered dot spawn
cFrame = &myAudio::updateAudioFrame(b); // pull latest FFT + RMS frame
```

The `myAudio::` globals live in `audio/audioTypes.h`, which chains to FastLED's own `fl/audio/audio.h` and `fl/audio/fft/fft.h` (new in FastLED 4.x). Three frequency-band beat detectors (`busA` = kick/bass, `busB` = snare/mid, `busC` = vocals/lead) each expose `newBeat` (bool) and `avResponse` (float). A per-frame `AudioFrame` snapshot carries RMS, peak, FFT bins, vox confidence, and copies of all three bus outputs.

`emitAudioDots()` listens to `busB` and `busC` beats and spawns dots at random positions. Everything else in the engine is audio-unaware.

**The remaining problem**

`audioTypes.h` defines its bus and config objects as non-`inline` variables at namespace scope. Including it from two TUs (e.g. `flowFieldsEngine.cpp` and `main.cpp`) causes linker "multiple definition" errors. This is why step 1 uses a compile-time guard rather than simply including the audio headers in `flowFieldsEngine.cpp`.

**What still needs to happen**

1. ~~**Guard the audio references**~~ ✅ Done — `#ifdef AUDIO_ENABLED` guard with no-op stub in `emitters_other.h`.

2. **Expose an audio data pointer on the engine** — add an optional `const myAudio::AudioFrame* audioFrame = nullptr;` field (or a generic equivalent) to `FlowFieldsEngine`. Library consumers set it before each `run()` call. Emitters read from it instead of calling `myAudio::updateAudioFrame()` directly.

3. **FastLED-MM integration** — a FastLED-MM consumer would pull an `AudioFrame` from FastLED's audio API each loop and pass it to the engine:
   ```cpp
   void loop() override {
       engine_.audioFrame = myAudio::getLatestFrame();  // or equivalent FA API
       engine_.run(leds_);
   }
   ```

This approach keeps the engine itself audio-agnostic — it holds a pointer that is either null (no audio, emitter is a no-op) or valid (audio data flows through).

#### Typed cVar storage

**Why everything is currently `float`**

The BLE transport sends all parameter values as JSON floating-point numbers (`{id: "inNumDots", val: 3.0}`). `processNumber()` receives a `float` and assigns it directly to the cVar. The `resolveCVar()` / `bindParam()` binding mechanism also returns `float*`, so any non-float cVar is invisible to library consumers.

The PARAMETER_TABLE X-macro *does* carry the intended type — `X(uint8_t, NumDots, 3)`, `X(bool, AxisFreezeX, false)`, `X(uint16_t, NoiseGateOpen, 70)` — and uses it for preset serialization. But the live cVar storage was never made to match, because the single-TU BLE firmware was the only consumer and implicit float→uint8_t narrowing silently worked.

`cNumDots` was changed to `float` during the Session 2 binding-gap fix as the path of least resistance. Several others should also be their real types:

| cVar | Current type | Natural type |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| `cNumDots` | `float` (was `uint8_t`) | `uint8_t` |
| `cBright` | `uint8_t` | `uint8_t` ✓ (not bound) |
| `cUseRainbow`, `cAxisFreezeX/Y/Z`, `cOutward` | `bool` | `bool` (not bound) |
| `cNoiseGateOpen`, `cNoiseGateClose` | `uint16_t` | `uint16_t` (not bound) |
| `maxBins`, `autoFloor`, `avLeveler` | `bool` | `bool` (not bound) |

**What needs to happen**

`resolveCVar` and `bindParam` would need typed overloads (or a tagged-union / `std::variant` slot) so that `uint8_t`, `bool`, and `uint16_t` cVars can participate in binding without being widened to `float`. The BLE `processNumber()` already has the type available via the X-macro and could cast on assignment instead of relying on implicit conversion.

## Session 3 Retrospective

Session 3 addressed four areas: a latent bug in the binding mechanism (controls not updating), encapsulation of two remaining global variables, PSRAM-aware memory allocation, and dimension-type widening for large-panel support.

### Definition of Done

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| `EMITTER`/`FLOW` global encapsulation | ✅ | Moved into `FlowFieldsEngine` as `_emitter`/`_flow` members; `bleControl.h` updated to read/write via `g_engine->_emitter`/`_flow`; extern declarations removed from `parameterSchema.h` |
| PSRAM-aware grid allocation | ✅ | `ps_malloc()` used for all 8 float arrays (gR/gG/gB, tR/tG/tB, xProf, yProf) on `BOARD_HAS_PSRAM` devices; `malloc()` fallback otherwise; both freed with `free()` |
| Binding fix — controls not propagating in FastLED-MM | ✅ | Root cause found and fixed; `resolveField` replaces `resolveCVar`; bindings now target struct fields directly and are applied after `syncFromCVars()` |
| Dimension type widening | ✅ | `_width`/`_height`/`_minDim`: `uint8_t` → `uint16_t`; `_numLeds`: `uint16_t` → `uint32_t`; `xyFunc` return: `uint16_t` → `uint32_t`; supports up to 1024×1024 (1M pixels) for PC targets |
| `EMITTER_NAMES` / `FLOW_NAMES` arrays | ✅ | Added as `inline const char*` arrays to `componentEnums.h`, parallel to the enum definitions; available to any consumer without pulling in BLE infrastructure |
| `FlowFieldsEffect.h` — select option population | ✅ | `addSelectOption` loops added for emitter and flow controls using the new name arrays |

### Change Details

#### 1. `EMITTER` / `FLOW` global encapsulation

`EMITTER` and `FLOW` were `uint8_t` globals defined in `main.cpp` and declared `extern` in `parameterSchema.h`. Any library consumer had to define them manually in their own code — a leaking implementation detail that caused linker errors in FastLED-MM.

Both are now `uint8_t _emitter` / `uint8_t _flow` members of `FlowFieldsEngine`. The BLE layer writes through `g_engine->_emitter` and `g_engine->_flow`; library consumers control them via `bindParam("emitter", ...)` / `bindParam("flow", ...)` exactly like any other parameter. **The standalone firmware is unaffected** — BLE callbacks work identically, just through the engine pointer that was already required.

#### 2. PSRAM-aware grid allocation

The eight float arrays that hold the pixel colour grid (six `float**` colour channels plus `xProf`/`yProf` noise profiles) are the largest allocations in the engine. On PSRAM-equipped boards (S3, S3 mini, etc.) they previously landed in the small internal DRAM heap, limiting usable panel size and leaving SPIRAM idle.

A `psramAlloc(count)` helper now calls `ps_malloc()` when `BOARD_HAS_PSRAM` is defined, with a `malloc()` fallback. `free()` is used for both (valid on ESP32). The change is gated by the standard build flag — boards without PSRAM compile and run identically to before. **This is a direct improvement for the standalone firmware** on any PSRAM-equipped ESP32.

#### 3. Binding fix — controls not propagating (`resolveField`)

This was the most important fix in Session 3. In FastLED-MM, moving a slider had no visible effect on the engine even though `bindParam` appeared to work at startup.

**Root cause — execution order in `run()`:**

The old sequence was:
1. Copy external floats → cVars (binding step)
2. On emitter/flow change: `pushDefaultsToCVars()` — **overwrites cVars with struct defaults**
3. `syncFromCVars()` — structs get the defaults, not the external values

`pushDefaultsToCVars()` fires on the first frame (because `lastEmitter` starts at 255) and on every emitter or flow switch, silently discarding whatever the binding had written. A secondary bug: `persistence` was split into `cPersistence + cPersistFine`; the binding wrote only to `cPersistence`, so `cPersistFine` accumulated as a permanent offset.

**Fix — two changes working together:**

**(a)** `resolveCVar` renamed to `resolveField` and changed to return **struct field pointers** (`&orbitalDots.orbitSpeed`, `&noiseFlow.xSpeed`, `&globalSpeed`, `&persistence`, …) instead of cVar global pointers. Special cases that need cVar fan-out (shared params like `numDots`, `dotDiam`, `blendFactor`; and uint8_t-target params like `lineClamp`, `solverIterations`) keep cVar pointers — these are documented in the function with a comment explaining the one-frame lag.

**(b)** Binding application **moved to after `syncFromCVars()`** in `run()`. The new sequence is:

```
1. pushDefaultsToCVars()  — if emitter/flow changed: defaults → cVars
2. syncFromCVars()        — BLE path:  cVars → struct fields
3. binding loop           — library path: external floats → same struct fields (overrides step 2)
```

Because bindings write to the struct fields that the emitters and flows read directly — and they run last — external values always win, regardless of what `pushDefaultsToCVars` or `syncFromCVars` wrote. The `persistence` split bug disappears because "persistence" now resolves to `&persistence` (the engine member), which `syncFromCVars` writes and the binding then overrides with the raw external value.

**The BLE firmware path is unchanged.** BLE writes to cVars; `syncFromCVars` copies to structs; no bindings are registered so the binding loop is a no-op. Existing behaviour is bit-for-bit identical.

#### 4. Dimension type widening

`_width` and `_height` were `uint8_t` (max 255), `_numLeds` was `uint16_t` (max 65 535). PC targets running the engine as a library can address panels of 1024×1024 = ~1 M pixels — both limits are far exceeded.

Changed to `uint16_t` for the spatial dimensions and `uint32_t` for the LED count, propagated consistently through `setup()`, `allocGrid()`, `freeGrid()`, the LED-copy loop, `xyFunc` pointer type, `myXY` in `boardConfig.h` and the example, `ledNum` in `main.cpp`, and the index arithmetic (explicit `(uint32_t)y * width + x` cast to prevent 16-bit overflow). ESP32 builds are unaffected — the wider types have identical runtime cost on a 32-bit MCU.

#### 5. `EMITTER_NAMES` / `FLOW_NAMES` in `componentEnums.h`

The emitter and flow name strings existed only in `parameterSchema.h` — a BLE-infrastructure header not appropriate to include from a library consumer. `componentEnums.h` is the natural home for them: they are the string counterpart of the enum values defined in the same file.

Two `inline const char*` arrays were added:

```cpp
inline const char* const EMITTER_NAMES[EMITTER_COUNT] = {
    "orbitaldots", "swarmingdots", "audiodots", "lissajous",
    "borderrect",  "noisekaleido", "cube",       "fluidjet"
};

inline const char* const FLOW_NAMES[FLOW_COUNT] = {
    "noise", "radial", "directional", "rings", "spiral", "fluid"
};
```

Any consumer that includes `FlowFieldsEngine.h` already gets `componentEnums.h` transitively. No PROGMEM — that is a firmware-specific concern handled separately in `parameterSchema.h`.

#### 6. Select option population in `FlowFieldsEffect.h`

The example was registering emitter and flow controls as `"select"` type but never populating the option list, leaving the UI with a numeric range but no labels. Two `addSelectOption` loops now follow each `addControl` call:

```cpp
addControl(emitterIdx_, "emitter", "select", 0.0f, (float)(EMITTER_COUNT - 1), 0.0f);
for (int i = 0; i < EMITTER_COUNT; i++)
    addSelectOption(emitterIdx_, EMITTER_NAMES[i]);
```

The loop is indexing the same `EMITTER_NAMES` array whose order matches the `Emitter` enum — no possibility of label/value mismatch.

### What Went Well

- **The binding bug had a clean fix.** Once the execution order in `run()` was understood, the solution was a targeted reorder plus a rename (`resolveCVar` → `resolveField`) with updated return values. No architecture changes outside `flowFieldsEngine.cpp`.
- **PSRAM allocation is fully backwards compatible.** The `#if defined(BOARD_HAS_PSRAM)` guard means boards without PSRAM see exactly the old behaviour. Adding the flag to `platformio.ini` is the only step needed to enable PSRAM on a new board.
- **Type widening required no logic changes.** Widening integer types on a 32-bit MCU is safe by construction — no overflow, no silent truncation. The only required care was the `xyFunc` index computation, which got an explicit cast.
- **`EMITTER_NAMES`/`FLOW_NAMES` close a gap in the library's API surface.** Before this change, a consumer had no way to get human-readable names for the enum values without depending on the BLE layer.

### What Didn't Go So Well

- **The binding bug was not caught in Session 2.** The `bindParam` mechanism was designed and tested conceptually but not exercised in FastLED-MM against a running UI. The ordering problem (`pushDefaultsToCVars` silently overwriting binding results) only became visible when a real consumer moved a slider and saw no response.
- **`resolveField` has two tiers of correctness.** Most params resolve directly to struct fields (immediate effect). A few shared or type-cast params (`numDots`, `dotDiam`, `blendFactor`, `lineClamp`, `solverIterations`) still go through cVars and take effect one frame later. This is documented and invisible in practice, but it is an inconsistency that could surprise someone adding a new parameter.

### Remaining Backlog (updated)

| Item | Priority | Notes |
|------|----------|-------|
| Verify visuals on device with FastLED 4.x | High | Do before merging to `main` |
| Audio integration steps 2–3 | Medium | Engine audio-data pointer + FastLED-MM loop wiring |
| Typed cVar storage | Low | Non-float cVars not reachable via `resolveField`; typed overloads needed |
| `resolveField` two-tier consistency | Low | Shared/cast params have one-frame lag via cVar; could be eliminated by adding fan-out in the binding loop |
